# e-comercee-big-project
<p>a simple e-comercee application</p>

---
## Why I worked in this project

<p>I made this app for final examination sekolah fullstack</p>

## used technologies
<ul>
  <li>Frontend : react, redux, sweetalert2, bootstrap </li>
  <li>backend : nodejs, express, fastest-Validator </li>
  <li>API testing : postman </li>
  <li>database : mySQL with sequelizeORM</li>
</ul> 

## why I build this way?
<ul>
  <li>this is my first fullstack project, you may find some hardcode</li>
  <li>due to my lack understanding of mySQL I use sequelizeORM. but I prefer to build manually because I want full control to mydatabase</li>
  <li>from this project, I find that you dont need many CSS files</li>
  <li>naming class element is sucks :( </li>
  
</ul>
