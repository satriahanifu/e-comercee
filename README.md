<p>a simple e-comercee application</p>

## Why I worked in this project

<p>I made this app for final examination sekolah fullstack</p>

## the goal of this project

<ul>
  <li>to simulate a professional web app development</li>
  <li>asses student understanding students technical understanding </li>
  <li>as student's portofolio</li>
</ul> 

## used technologies

<ul>
  <li>Frontend : react, redux, sweetalert2, bootstrap </li>
  <li>backend : nodejs, express, fastest-Validator </li>
  <li>API testing : postman </li>
  <li>database : mySQL with sequelizeORM</li>
</ul> 

## why I build this way?

<ul>
  <li>this is my first fullstack project, you may find some hardcodes</li>
  <li>due to my lack understanding of mySQL I use sequelizeORM. but I prefer to build manually because I want full control to my database</li>
  <li>from this project, I find that you dont need many CSS files just one app.css</li>
  <li>naming class element is sucks :( </li>
  <li>I find that react components is a cool features, but it will trouble you when you willing to make a dynamic component</li>
  <li>I find that testing API without automation test will trouble you. so, learn to create automation test script!</li>
  
</ul> 

## available script

back-end app (be file)
